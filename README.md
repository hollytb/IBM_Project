(1) py vanialla_tracker.py (cd back-end/Tracker) (creates output.json)   
(2) npm start (cd back-end) (http://localhost:9000/IntensityAPI)
(3) npm start (cd client2) (localhost:3000)
```
## Installation (back_end)

We assume that you have python 3 and openCV installed as they are the two prerequisites.

If not you can install python 3 using brew or pip.
To install opencv you can use:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### Installation (front_end)
```
(1) npm install react-google-charts          
(2) npm install react-player          
(3) npm install bootstrap           
(4) npm install react-dom           
```   

### Video.mp4
This video is screenrecorded from when the vanilla_tracker.py is run.
